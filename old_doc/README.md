# PSA CAN

Heavily edited version of http://autowp.github.io/ to maximise readability and be able to generate the html from yaml data
There's only the data for PSA's peugeot 207 here.
CAN data from Alexandre Blin (https://github.com/alexandreblin/arduino-peugeot-can), autowp (https://github.com/autowp/autowp.github.io) and my own reverse engineering

# WARNING: this is a ugly hack!
